/**
 * Direction of the interactive swipe that dismisses (pops) the current top entry.
 *
 * The renderer maps the finger travel along the matching axis onto the shared `animatedTop` driver
 * 1:1, so the dismiss gesture follows the same axis as the transition: a horizontal slide is
 * dismissed by a horizontal swipe, a bottom-up modal by a downward swipe. The values are **physical
 * screen directions** (which way the finger moves) and are NOT mirrored for layout direction — so
 * the "back" swipe is [LeftToRight] under LTR but [RightToLeft] under RTL; pick accordingly.
 *
 * Swipe-to-dismiss is opt-in: a [NavTransition] may declare a direction via
 * [NavTransition.dismissDirection] (none of the [NavTransitions] presets do by default), and a route
 * may set or override it (including disabling with [None]) through the `entry(swipeDismiss = …)` DSL.
